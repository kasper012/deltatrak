<p><strong>ISO/IEC 17025</strong> is the single most important standard for calibration and testing laboratories around the world. Laboratories that are accredited to this international standard have demonstrated that they are technically competent and able to produce precise and accurate calibration data, specifying general requirements for the competence to carry out calibrations.</p>

<p><strong>Accreditation</strong> is a voluntary, third party-reviewed process. As part of accreditation, a laboratory's quality management system is thoroughly evaluated on a regular basis to ensure continued technical competence and compliance with ISO/IEC 17025.</p>
