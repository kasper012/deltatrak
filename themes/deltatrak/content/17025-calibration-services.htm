<p><strong>ISO/IEC 17025</strong> is the single most important standard for calibration and testing laboratories around the world. Laboratories that are accredited to this international standard have demonstrated that they are technically competent and able to produce precise and accurate calibration data, specifying general requirements for the competence to carry out calibrations.</p>

<p><strong>Accreditation</strong> is a voluntary, third party-reviewed process. As part of accreditation, a laboratory's quality management system is thoroughly evaluated on a regular basis to ensure continued technical competence and compliance with ISO/IEC 17025.</p>

<h4>17025 Calibration and Certification Services</h4>

<p><strong>Single and Multi-Point Calibration for:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Temperature comparison calibration in fluid</li>
	<li>Digital Probe Thermometers</li>
	<li>Folding Probe Thermometers</li>
	<li>Heat/Cool Thermometers</li>
	<li>FlashLink Data Loggers</li>
	<li>Circular Chart Recorders (with external probes)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Service Includes:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Calibration Certificate that is ISO/IEC 17025</li>
	<li>Sticker with calibration information for annual maintenance</li>
	<li>Battery Change (on calibration renewal service)</li>
</ul>

<p>Certificates of calibration include an in-depth summary of the tool, deviations, and any out-of-tolerance conditions. Each thermometer has a unique serial number for future traceability and reference.</p>

<p>The laboratory decision rule for proving conformance or non-conformance to specification is: The test tolerance, pass/fail, is raw data and does not account for the uncertainty of measurement.</p>
