		<p>The FlashTrak Telematics Cold-Storage Facility solution shall provide temperature monitoring of products being stored in a cold storage warehouse and display information on a data enabled tablet via the Facility Control System (FCS). It will offer the customer the ability to keep a close watch on their cold storage warehouse temperatures using a combination of our Loggers and Repeaters (optional). The data will be uploaded to ColdTrak Data Central using either the cellular data network or WiFi at which point the customer has access to it anywhere in the world.</p>

		<p>In this solution, the shipper of the temperature sensitive products will use FlashTrak TM Data Loggers to record ambient air and/or product temperature within a facility. The FlashTrak TM/TMX Data Loggers are in strategic locations to giv<span class="fr-tmp fr-em">F</span><span class="fr-tmp fr-sm">F</span>e a wide coverage area and can be mounted anywhere the customer wishes to monitor air temperature. The combination of loggers and repeaters will communicate wirelessly with the Facility Control System (FCS) installed where management can view temperatures on the tablet in real time. All of the data will be automatically uploaded to ColdTrak where reports and alarm conditions can be pre-set for notification as needed.</p>

The system provides the ability to create a circular area around a location by using its latitude and longitude coordinates, and will track devices entering or leaving the geo-fenced area. Alerts can send automatic notification via SMS, email and/or voice recorded messages for entry/exit to the specified perimeters. For example, on a delivery route from a distribution center to multiple stores, when the vehicle enters the geo-fence for a particular store, the store manager will get a message with time of entry and temperature of products being delivered.</div></div></div>

					<div class="card-body">Most temperature sensing solutions are designed to measure ambient air temperatures, but it is more important to know how the product itself reacts to the changes in its environment. DeltaTrak has implemented a product temperature modeling algorithm which can improve the efficiency by emulating the true impact of temperature changes in the product being transported. Often transport vehicles experience changes in the storage temperature through door opening events, less than optimal refrigeration unit operation, and even during refrigeration power failures. These are some of the conditions that directly impact the internal temperatures of the product being transported. The largest benefit of Product Emulation is knowing actual product temperature without having to physically probe and damage the commodity.</div></div></div>

Real-time and historic temperature statistics can be viewed in both numerical and graphical formats. This has applications in both air-transit and in-transit models because it conserves the battery of the logger by putting it into hibernation when not reporting data to the MCS. This feature is especially important for air shipments because it ensures that logger signals are not transmitted during flight, to avoid possible interference with airplane navigation systems.</div></div></div>
