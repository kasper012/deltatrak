					<p>DeltaTrak FlashTrak Telematics solutions use modern state-of-the-art technology combined with the
						latest M2M communications to provide focused cost effective monitoring/tracking of refrigerated
						transport vehicles, containers, packages, and stationary cold storage facilities. While most
						telematics solutions in the industry focus on vehicle telemetry, fuel efficiency, driver habits
						and operational benefits, DeltaTrakâ€™s FlashTrak solutions allow users to improve product quality
						by providing key data that will help increase product shelf life. As a result, customers will
						achieve higher revenues and gain a larger percentage of sellable products, directly resulting in
						lower shrinkage.</p>
