<p><strong>Calibration</strong>: The tuning of an instrument according to a standard value.</p>

<p><strong>Calibration Verification</strong>: The act of confirming that a device or instrument is properly calibrated.</p>

<p><strong>CFR</strong>: Code of Federal Regulations</p>

<p><strong>CFR (21) Part 11</strong>: Federal regulations stating that electronic records and signatures are considered equivalent to paper records.</p>

<p><strong>Colony Forming Unit (CFU)</strong>: CFU is a measure of viable (live) bacterial or fungal numbers. Unlike direct microscopic counts where all cells, dead and living, are counted, CFU measures viable cells. Results are given as CFU/mL (colony-forming units per milliliter) for liquids, and CFU/g (colony-forming units per gram) for solids</p>

<p><strong>cGMP</strong>: Current Good Manufacturing Practices</p>

<p><strong>Chart Recorder</strong>: An electronic instrument that records the ambient temperature of an environmental testing chamber.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Chain Management</strong>: A temperature-controlled supply chain. Goods in a cold chain must be maintained throughout at a consistent temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Chain Product</strong>: A product that is temperature sensitive.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Chain</strong>: An uninterrupted flow of a specific thermal profile throughout the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of a temperature-sensitive product.</p>

<p><strong>Colorimetric assay</strong>: A test using instruments that measures the concentration of a known constituent of a solution by comparison with colors of standard solutions. These instruments are used to determine or specify colors, as by comparison with spectroscopic or visual standards.</p>

<p><strong>Culture medium</strong>: A growth medium or culture medium is a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of microorganisms or cells,[1] or small plants like the moss Physcomitrella patens.[2]There are different types of media for growing different types of cells.[3]</p>
