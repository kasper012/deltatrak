<p><strong>E. coli</strong>: Escherichia coli or E. coli is a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (humans, birds etc). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some, such as serotype O157:H7, can cause serious food poisoning in humans, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls.</p>

<p><strong>Efficacy</strong>: The ability to produce a desired outcome.</p>

<p><strong>EIASee ELISA:&nbsp;</strong>ELISAEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also known as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. The ELISA has been used as a diagnostic tool in medicine and plant pathology, as well as a quality-control check in various industries.</p>

<p><strong>Enterobacteriaceae</strong>: Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of gram-negative bacteria, including many familiar pathogens, such as Salmonella and E. coli.</p>

<p><strong>Enterococcus</strong>: Enterococci are regular inhabitants of the bowel. The genome of E. faecalis is more than 25% exogenously acquired DNA. Enterococci are the leading cause of hospital-acquired secondary infections.</p>

<p><strong>Enzymes</strong>: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze (i.e., increase the rates of) chemical reactions. At any given moment, all of the work being done inside any cell is being done by enzymes. The purpose of an enzyme in a cell is to allow the cell to carry out chemical reactions very quickly. These reactions allow the cell to build things or take things apart as needed. This is how a cell grows and reproduces.</p>

<p><strong>Excursion</strong>: Deviation from a specified limit.</p>

<p><strong>Excursion Limit</strong>: A defined allowable deviation from a specified limit.</p>

<p><strong>External Temperature Cycle</strong>: The ambient temperature that the shipping container witnesses for each step of the transit process (packaging, warehouse, transit, etc.).</p>
