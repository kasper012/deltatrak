<p><strong>Salmonella</strong>: Salmonella bacteria are rod-shaped, flagellated, Gram stain-negative, and are known to cause disease in humans, animals, and birds (especially poultry) worldwide. The two major diseases caused by Salmonella spp. are gastroenteritis and typhoid fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fevers) in humans.</p>

<p><strong>Sanitization</strong>: The process of reducing microorganisms and their spores to generally safe levels through the use of chemical, heat or both.</p>

<p><strong>Shelf Life</strong>: The length of time that a product or device maintains its effectiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping</strong>: The process of transporting a package from one location to another.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping System</strong>: The insulated shipping container and its internal thermal packaging components (refrigerants, buffering materials, dunnage, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>SOP</strong>: Standard Operating Procedures</p>

<p><strong>SPE</strong>: Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering</p>

<p><strong>Stability</strong>: Often refers to the ability of a product to remain efficacious under varying temperature/time exposures.</p>

<p><strong>Storage Temperature</strong>: The temperature at which a product is stored.</p>

<p><strong>Substrate</strong>: In biochemistry, a substrate is a molecule upon which an enzyme acts. Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions involving the substrate(s). In the case of a single substrate, the substrate binds with the enzyme active site, and an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. The substrate is transformed into one or more products, which are then released from the active site. The active site is now free to accept another substrate molecule. In the case of more than one substrate, these may bind in a particular order to the active site, before reacting together to produce products.</p>
