<p>DeltaTrakâ€™s GoGreen Recycling Program supports corporate objectives for environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Recycling e-waste reduces pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and saves energy. DeltaTrak strives to design and build products that take into consideration the practice of recovering and recycling. As part of our GoGreen Recycling Program, we encourage receivers to return used data loggers to DeltaTrak.</p>
