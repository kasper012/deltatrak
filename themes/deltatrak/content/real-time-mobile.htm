<p>The FlashTrak Telematics Real-Time Mobile Solution provides the tools to monitor trucks 24/7 as they travel across the country. It offers the ability to monitor commodities with ambient temperature, GPS location, actual product temperature using DeltaTrak's unique Product Emulation feature, and keep up to date with specific alerts which can be determined by the user's needs. The data is uploaded to ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service using either the cellular data network or WiFi, at which point the user has access from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In this solution, the shipper of the temperature sensitive products uses FlashTrak TM Data Loggers to record ambient air and/or actual product temperature, and uses ColdTrak Data Central to set parameters for alert notifications. The FlashTrak TM Data Loggers are mounted inside truck trailers and wirelessly communicate temperature measurements to a Mobile Control System (MCS) that is installed in the truck cab. The solution provides real-time monitoring of the products and notifies the user of temperature excursions by audio alarms, text messages, and emails. All of the data is automatically uploaded to ColdTrak Data Central, where it is analyzed and reports are generated.</p>

<p>/////////</p>

<p>A geo-fence is a predefined area or boundary for a real-world geographic location. The system provides the ability to create a circular area around a location by using its latitude and longitude coordinates, and will track devices entering or leaving the geo-fenced area. Alerts can send automatic notification via SMS, email and/or voice recorded messages for entry/exit to the specified perimeters. For example, on a delivery route from a distribution center to multiple stores, when the vehicle enters the geo-fence for a particular store, the store manager will get a message with time of entry and temperature of products being delivered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>////////////</p>

<p>Most temperature sensing solutions are designed to measure ambient air temperatures, but it is more important to know how the product itself reacts to the changes in its environment. DeltaTrak has implemented a product temperature modeling algorithm which can improve the efficiency by emulating the true impact of temperature changes in the product being transported. Often transport vehicles experience changes in the storage temperature through door opening events, less than optimal refrigeration unit operation, and even during refrigeration power failures. These are some of the conditions that directly impact the internal temperatures of the product being transported. The largest benefit of Product Emulation is knowing actual product temperature without having to physically probe and damage the commodity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>//////////</p>

<p>The Alerts feature include email, SMS text and voice recorded messages which can be configured and then sent to designated recipients when the various specified alert conditions occur. The system includes a wide range of alerts including:</p>

<ul>

	<ul>

<p>/////////</p>

<p>The FlashTrak MCS is the main control unit in mobile applications where it will be traveling with a truck/trailer unit, and is able to report temperature in real-time. The MCS is self contained in a sealed plastic case and has provisions for power connection to a constant 12-volt power source. The primary responsibility of the MCS is to collect data from the TM Loggers and upload information to ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service. It also provides GPS coordinates of the truck. No driver interaction is required with FlashTrak equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<div aria-hidden="false" aria-labelledby="slider-tmx-logger-high-power">

	<p>FlashTrak TMX Data Loggers operate on internal battery power. No external power source or connection is required. In facility applications these high power TMX loggers are installed in cold storage rooms, processing areas, blast freezers and reach-in refrigerators where a stronger signal is needed to penetrate thick steel doors which usually have seals. For mobile applications, the TMX logger will be utilized when customers require a second channel to monitor another temperature point, such as door openings. Any application which requires maximum signal connectivity will require the TMX Logger. Each logger communicates with the FCS/MCS receiver (through a repeater if needed), and allows the data to be uploaded to ColdTrak where it can be reviewed by management.</p>
