                        <div><strong>Bacteria</strong>: Bacteria are microscopic organisms, usually
                            consisting of one cell, that lack chlorophyll (a green pigment found in plants
                            that allows for the production of food). Except for viruses, they are the

                        <div><strong>Bacteriological Analytical Manual (B.A.M.)</strong>: FDA's
                            Bacteriological Analytical Manual (The BAM) is a collection of procedures
                            preferred by analysts in U.S. Food and Drug Administration laboratories for the
                            detection in food and cosmetic products of pathogens (bacterial, viral,
                            parasitic, plus yeast and mold) and of microbial toxins. Except for some rapid
                            methods listed in its Appendix 1, all these methods have been used and peer
                            reviewed by FDA scientists as well as by scientists outside FDA. However, not
                            all of these methods have been fully validated by collaborative studies. In some
                            instances, collaborative studies are not possible because uniform test samples
                            cannot be prepared (as with encysted parasites). In other instances, FDA needs
                            to use a method before the time it takes to achieve full validation. At first
                            (1965, Edition 1), the BAM was intended to be only a vehicle for information and
                            standardization within FDA. However, the manual's reputation as useful spread
                            beyond the agency. Requests for copies proliferated and it was decided to make
                            the BAM generally available.</div>
                        <div><strong>BAM</strong>: FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) presents

                            foods and cosmetics. AOAC International published previous editions of this
                            manual in a loose-leaf notebook format, and, more recently, on CD-ROM. This
                            online BAM is now available to the public.</div>

                            cells adhere to each other and/or to a surface with sticky by-products formed by
                            these cells. Biofilm can adhere to living or non-living surfaces and can hide

                            done inside any cell is being done by enzymes. The purpose of an enzyme in a
                            cell is to allow the cell to carry out chemical reactions very quickly. These
                            reactions allow the cell to build things or take things apart as needed. This is
                            how a cell grows and reproduces.</div>

                            by themselves are usually not pathogenic; they are indicator organisms, which
                            means they may indicate the presence of other pathogenic bacteria.</div>
                        <div><strong>Fluorescence</strong>: Fluorescence is luminescence that occurs where
                            the energy is supplied by electromagnetic radiation, usually ultraviolet light.
                            The energy source kicks an electron of an atom from a lower energy state into an
                            "excited" higher energy state; then the electron releases the energy in the form
                            of light (luminescence) when it falls back to a lower energy state. Examples:
                            fluorescent lights, the red glow of rubies in sunlight.</div>
                        <div><strong>Fluorometer</strong>: A fluorometer or fluorimeter is a device used to
                            measure parameters of fluorescence: its intensity and wavelength distribution of
                            emission spectrum after excitation by a certain spectrum of light. These
                            parameters are used to identify the presence and the amount of specific
                            molecules in a medium. Modern fluorometers are capable of detecting fluorescent
                            molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion.</div>

                        <div><strong>Gram-negative bacteria</strong>: Gram-Negative Bacteria are simply
                            called so because of their detection by the Gram's Stain test in which they do
                            not retain the crystal violet color (dye) in their cell wall. The Gram-Negative
                            bacteria cell-wall holds the pink or reddish dye once a counter stain chemical
                            is used. There are many groups of Gram-Negative bacteria such as Cyanobacteria,
                            Spirochaetes, Green-Sulphur and Green Non-Sulphur Bacteria and Proteobacteria
                            etc. Out of which, proteobacteria is one of the major group of known
                            Gram-Negative bacteria (it includes bacteria like E-coli, Salmonella,

                        <div><strong>Gram-positive bacteria</strong>: Gram-positive bacteria are those that
                            are stained dark blue or violet by Gram staining. This is in contrast to
                            Gram-negative bacteria, which cannot retain the crystal violet stain, instead
                            taking up the counter stain (safranin or fuchsine) and appearing red or pink.
                            Gram-positive organisms are able to retain the crystal violet stain because of
                            the high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. Gram-positive cell walls
                            typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive
                            organisms include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus,

                            ingest or absorb food produced by other organisms. Therefore, the heterotrophs
                            rely on other organisms for their nutrition. Heterotrophic organisms include
                            animals, fungi, and some single-celled protozoa (e.g., ameba, paramecia) and
                            bacteria. While autotrophs make their own food by converting inorganic nutrients
                            into organic forms, heterotrophs cannot do this. Heterotrophs require most
                            nutrients in an already produced, organic form. They use these nutrients both as
                            a source of energy and as building blocks to form cell and body parts. In a food
                            web the heterotrophs are the consumers. There are many different types of

                            at normal and lower temperatures. In luminescence, some energy source kicks an
                            electron of an atom out of its lowest energy "ground" state into a higher energy
                            "excited" state; then the electron returns the energy in the form of light so it
                            can fall back to its "ground" state. With few exceptions, the excitation energy
                            is always greater than the energy (wavelength, color) of the emitted light.

                            Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium responsible
                            for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It may also be called
                            multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
                            aureus (ORSA). MRSA is, by definition, any strain of Staphylococcus aureus that
                            has developed resistance to beta-lactam (class of antibiotics) antibiotics which
                            include the penicillins (methicillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, etc.)
                            and the cephalosporins (class of beta-lactam antibiotics0. MRSA is especially
                            troublesome in hospitals and nursing homes where patients with open wounds,
                            invasive devices and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of infection

                            enzyme active site, and an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. The substrate is
                            transformed into one or more products, which are then released from the active
                            site. The active site is now free to accept another substrate molecule. In the
                            case of more than one substrate, these may bind in a particular order to the
                            active site, before reacting together to produce products.</div>
