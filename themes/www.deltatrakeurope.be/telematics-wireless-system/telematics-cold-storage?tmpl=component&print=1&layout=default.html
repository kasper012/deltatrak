	<meta name="twitter:description" content=" The FlashTrak Telematics Cold-Storage Facility solution shall provide temperature monitoring of products being stored in a cold storage warehouse and display information on a data enabled tablet via the Facility Control System . It will offer the customer the ability to keep a close watch on their cold storage warehouse temperatures using a combination of our Loggers and Repeaters . The data will be uploaded to ColdTrak Data Central using either the cellular data network or WiFi at which point the customer has access to it anywhere in the world. In this solution, the shipper of the temperature sensitive products will use FlashTrak TM Data Loggers to record ambient air and/or product temperature within a facility. The FlashTrak TM/TMX Data Loggers are in strategic locations to give a wide coverage area and can be mounted anywhere the customer wishes to monitor air temperature. The combination of loggers and repeaters will communicate wirelessly with the Facility Control System  installed where management can view temperatures on the tablet in real time. All of the data will be automatically uploaded to ColdTrak where reports and alarm conditions can be pre-set for notification as needed. GeoFence A geo-fence is a predefined area or boundary for a real-world geographic location. The system provides the ability to create a circular area around a location by using its latitude and longitude coordinates, and will track devices entering or leaving the geo-fenced area. Alerts can send automatic notification via SMS, email and/or voice recorded messages for entry/exit to the specified perimeters. For example, on a delivery route from a distribution center to multiple stores, when the vehicle enters the geo-fence for a particular store, the store manager will get a message with time of entry and temperature of products being delivered. Mobile M2M Data Service FlashTrak Telematics uses the latest Machine-to-Machine  communications technology and state-of-the-art applications to provide a complete solution for managing a globalized cold chain. We provide reliable data communication, maximum data coverage and access, and real-time information from locations around the world. A key feature of the Mobile M2M data service plan is that it is a self-contained stand-alone system capable of transmitting directly to ColdTrak cloud service without having to access the user’s network. It is provided as part of our solutions, and is based on usage and optimized for cost savings. ColdTrak Data Central  FlashTrak Telematics in conjunction with ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service, provides key solutions for monitoring temperature during all phases of the pharmaceutical cold chain starting with cold storage, during transportation, and finally during the critical last mile of distribution to the patient. Our solutions provide documentation that addresses the need for traceability and access to important data at any time and from any location. Each customer has a user/super admin login to track all changes made to the secure system, thus ColdTrak/FlashTrak is FDA Title 21CFR Part 11 Compliant.

Google Maps The FlashTrak Telematics system incorporates world-class mapping technology from Google Maps. These maps are frequently updated and provide global coverage. Features such as satellite photography, draggable panning and detail down to street level are provided. Map operations such as zooming and centering can also be performed in a single screen. Flexible Reports ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service provides a flexible reporting tool that is used to create all the reports from data collected and sent by the FlashTrak telematic systems to ColdTrak. It includes the option for scheduling routine reports which can be automatically generated and emailed on a regular basis – weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. Reports are easily customized to meet the needs of the user. Custom reports can also be requested through DeltaTrak’s Technical Support Group. Following are some of the reports which can be produced in ColdTrak:  Vehicle Journey Summary Report:  A list of trips defined by starting point and time, trip end in relationship to time and location Vehicle Activity Report:  A list of all Temperature events including time and place Vehicle Timesheet Report: A summary of individual vehicle activity, times and locations Temperature Activity Report: All temperature and alert events for each data logger Geo-fence Report: A listing of entry and exit of set geo-fence boundaries Idle Time Report: A list of all vehicles idle for set periods of time Waypoint Report: A list of all locations visited by vehicles that are defined by customer’s locations Routing Analysis Report: A summary of the regions visited within a specified time period, and whether any vehicle went off-route  Facility Control System  The FlashTrak FCS is the main control unit which collects data from the loggers and uploads information to DeltaTrak’s ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service. The FCS includes a 7 inch tablet that is visible through the clear case cover so users can view temperature readings in real-time. The FCS runs on A/C power using the provided plug-in type wall transformer for primary power, and has a battery back-up to maintain power and network connections up to 24 hours. TMX Logger  FlashTrak TMX Data Loggers operate on internal battery power. No external power source or connection is required. In facility applications these high power TMX loggers are installed in cold storage rooms, processing areas, blast freezers and reach-in refrigerators where a stronger signal is needed to penetrate thick steel doors which usually have seals. For mobile applications, the TMX logger will be utilized when customers require a second channel to monitor another temperature point, such as door openings. Any application which requires maximum signal connectivity will require the TMX Logger. Each logger communicates with the FCS/MCS receiver , and allows the data to be uploaded to ColdTrak where it can be reviewed by management. TM Logger  FlashTrak TM Data Loggers operate on internal battery power. No external power source or connection is required.

<div id="facility-control-system-fcs" class="rl_sliders-print"><h3 class="rl_sliders-title nn_sliders-title"><a id="anchor-facility-control-system-fcs" class="anchor"></a>Facility Control System (FCS)</h3>
<p>The FlashTrak FCS is the main control unit which collects data from the loggers and uploads information to DeltaTrak’s ColdTrak Data Central cloud-based service. The FCS includes a 7 inch tablet that is visible through the clear case cover so users can view temperature readings in real-time. The FCS runs on A/C power using the provided plug-in type wall transformer for primary power, and has a battery back-up to maintain power and network connections up to 24 hours.</p>
<div id="tmx-logger-high-power" class="rl_sliders-print"><h3 class="rl_sliders-title nn_sliders-title"><a id="anchor-tmx-logger-high-power" class="anchor"></a>TMX Logger (high power)</h3>
<p>FlashTrak TMX Data Loggers operate on internal battery power. No external power source or connection is required. In facility applications these high power TMX loggers are installed in cold storage rooms, processing areas, blast freezers and reach-in refrigerators where a stronger signal is needed to penetrate thick steel doors which usually have seals. For mobile applications, the TMX logger will be utilized when customers require a second channel to monitor another temperature point, such as door openings. Any application which requires maximum signal connectivity will require the TMX Logger. Each logger communicates with the FCS/MCS receiver (through a repeater if needed), and allows the data to be uploaded to ColdTrak where it can be reviewed by management.</p>
<div id="tm-logger-compact" class="rl_sliders-print"><h3 class="rl_sliders-title nn_sliders-title"><a id="anchor-tm-logger-compact" class="anchor"></a>TM Logger (compact)</h3>
<p>FlashTrak TM Data Loggers operate on internal battery power. No external power source or connection is required. For mobile applications these compact TM loggers are mounted in trucks with a custom metal mounting bracket for protection. Optionally, TM Loggers can be placed inside crates or cartons with fresh produce, to monitor commodities during transit. In facility applications, TM loggers can be mounted on shelving or warehouse racking systems. Each logger communicates with the FCS/MCS receiver (through a repeater if needed), and allows the data to be uploaded to ColdTrak where it can be reviewed by management.</p>
<div id="tmx-repeater" class="rl_sliders-print"><h3 class="rl_sliders-title nn_sliders-title"><a id="anchor-tmx-repeater" class="anchor"></a>TMX Repeater</h3>
<p>The FlashTrak TM Repeater operates on A/C power via a direct plug-in type wall transformer. The combination of repeaters and FlashTrak loggers is designed to give superb coverage to an entire facility with maximum connectivity. The repeaters will be deployed as needed, to allow flexibility for positioning the FCS receiver in a remote office while still maintaining signal and network integrity.</p>
