As soon as you receive your DeltaTrak devices they are ready to be placed into a container. Preferably the DeltaTrak device should be attached to the last row of container load.  The person handling the devices simply just need to follow a couple of simple steps to set the device up properly:   To start the logger press and hold the green POWER button on top of the unit until the green LED is flashing. Remove the label containing the serial number on the packaging and attach to your shipping documents. Use adhesive strips on the back of card to place logger on pallet or package.

Please see the Getting Started section for more information about this.  General Questions:  How is the DeltaTrak device connected to Internet? They use 2G GSM to connect to internet in very similar way as a mobile phone. The device is equipped with a pre-paid SIM card that works world wide.  Why hasn't my DeltaTrak device updated in a while? There is many possible reasons why the device doesn't have connectivity.  If the device is in a steel container in a rural area with bad GSM coverage or out at sea outside GSM reach the device will not be able to connect. However the device is still measuring and collecting sensor data even if there's is no GSM connectivity. As soon as the device is within GSM reach all data from last successful connection will be uploaded to the web front-end.  If you use your DeltaTrak device in reefer containers GSM signal is also affected by how the container is stacked on a ship or in a harbor. For instance if your container is in the middle of many other containers it might be very difficult to get GSM connectivity. However - as soon as your container is moved or transferred to another location all data from the last successful connection should be uploaded to the web front-end.

<h2>General Questions:</h2>

<h4>How is the DeltaTrak device connected to Internet?</h4>
<p>They use 2G GSM to connect to internet in very similar way as a mobile phone. The device is equipped with a pre-paid SIM card that works world wide.</p>

<h4>Why hasn't my DeltaTrak device updated in a while?</h4>
<p>There is many possible reasons why the device doesn't have connectivity.</p>

<p>If the device is in a steel container in a rural area with bad GSM coverage or out at sea outside GSM reach the device will not be able to connect. However the device is still measuring and collecting sensor data even if there's is no GSM connectivity. As soon as the device is within GSM reach all data from last successful connection will be uploaded to the web front-end. </p>
<p>If you use your DeltaTrak device in reefer containers GSM signal is also affected by how the container is stacked on a ship or in a harbor. For instance if your container is in the middle of many other containers it might be very difficult to get GSM connectivity.
