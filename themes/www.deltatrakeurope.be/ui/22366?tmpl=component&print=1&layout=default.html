Using this feature, the RTL Prime loggers will temporarily disable transmission of data, while still monitoring and recording temperature and storing it in memory. When the loggers exit Flight Mode and there is cellular connection, all data points stored during this time will be transmitted and saved in the cloud application www.flashtrakrtl.com.  Turning on Flight Mode Press and hold down the red Flight Mode button on the RTL Prime logger for 5 seconds until the red LED flashes 5 times, then release the button. The logger has now entered Flight Mode.  To verify if a logger is in Flight Mode, a single press of the red Flight Mode button for 1 second will return 1 red LED flash to indicate the logger is in Flight Mode.  Automatic Shut Off RTL Prime exits Flight Mode using an internal countdown timer. After Flight Mode is activated, the pre-programed 24-hour timer must elapse before the logger will wake up and use cellular connection to start sending data to the cloud service web portal again. All data points stored while the logger was in Flight Mode will be transmitted.  Manual Shut Off Press and hold the Flight Mode button for 5 seconds until the red LED remains lit for a solid 5 seconds. This indicates the logger has exited from Flight Mode and will begin transmitting data again.

You login to the DeltaTrak service using your email address and password used creating your account.  I forgot my password, what now? At the login page you can find a link for resetting your password  Installing the DeltaTrak Logger:   To start the logger press and hold the green START button for 5 seconds until blue status LED is flashing.  The STATUS LED will flash 5 times to indicate it has started, and flash another 5 times to show the cellular signal is good.  If there is no cellular reception at the moment the blue STATUS light will stay lit for 5 seconds Remove barcode label with trip number from card, apply to shipping document.  Trip number on RTL matches PDF trip report for traceability. Use adhesive strips on back of card to place logger on pallet or package Scan the QR code for detailed information on enabling and disabling FLIGHT MODE   What is Flight Mode?  The Flight Mode is similar to the Airplane mode on your mobile device.  The RTL Prime can disable the data transmission of the RTL Prime logger while maintaining logging of temperature data.  The information will be stored so when the logger exits flight mode, it will report all data to our cloud.  The RTL Prime can only exit Flight Mode using a countdown internal timer.  This means once the Flight Mode is activated, the pre-programed elapsed time must pass before the logger will wake up and reconnect. MANUAL MODE:  Manually press and hold the Flight Mode button on the RTL Prime logger for 5 seconds, the logger will go from Recording Mode to Flight Mode.  The Flight Mode LED will blink RED 5 times to indicate logger has entered Flight Mode.  A single press of the Flight Mode button for 1 second will return a Red LED to indicate logger is in Flight Mode. Press and hold Flight Mode button for 5 seconds and the Red LED will go solid for 5 seconds and exit Flight Mode    Why is there a USB port on my device?  The USB port allows users to download data from the RTL Prime without having to access the cloud account.  Simply plug in the logger into a compatible USB port on the computer and a PDF report will be generated automatically For the RTL Prime 3G unit, there is a micro USB port at the bottom of the unit.  You will need a micro USB to USB cable to download the file   General Questions:  How is the DeltaTrak device connected to Internet? The RTL Prime uses 2G GSM and/or 3G GSM  to connect to internet in very similar way as a mobile phone. The device is equipped with a pre-paid SIM card that works world wide.  Why hasn't my DeltaTrak device updated in a while? There are many possible reasons why the device doesn't have connectivity.  If the device is in a steel container in a rural area with bad GSM coverage, or out at sea outside GSM reach, the device will not be able to connect. However the device is still measuring and collecting sensor data even if there's is no GSM connectivity. As soon as the device is within GSM reach, all data from last successful connection will be uploaded to the cloud.  If you use your DeltaTrak device in reefer containers GSM signal is also affected by how the container is stacked on a ship or in a harbor. For instance if your container is in the middle of many other containers it might be very difficult to get GSM connectivity. However - as soon as your container is moved or transferred to another location all data from the last successful connection should be uploaded to the cloud.

</div><div id="flight-mode" class="rl_tabs-print"><h2 class="rl_tabs-title nn_tabs-title"><a id="anchor-flight-mode" class="anchor"></a>Flight Mode</h2>
<h2>Flight Mode</h2>

<p>Flight Mode is similar to Airplane mode on your mobile device. Using this feature, the RTL Prime loggers will temporarily disable transmission of data, while still monitoring and recording temperature and storing it in memory. When the loggers exit Flight Mode and there is cellular connection, all data points stored during this time will be transmitted and saved in the cloud application <a href="http://www.flashtrakrtl.com" target="_blank">www.flashtrakrtl.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Turning on Flight Mode</h3>
<p>Press and hold down the red Flight Mode button on the RTL Prime logger for 5 seconds until the red LED flashes 5 times, then release the button. The logger has now entered Flight Mode.</p>

<p>To verify if a logger is in Flight Mode, a single press of the red Flight Mode button for 1 second will return 1 red LED flash to indicate the logger is in Flight Mode.</p>

<h3>Automatic Shut Off</h3>
<p>RTL Prime exits Flight Mode using an internal countdown timer. After Flight Mode is activated, the pre-programed 24-hour timer must elapse before the logger will wake up and use cellular connection to start sending data to the cloud service web portal again. All data points stored while the logger was in Flight Mode will be transmitted.</p>

<h3>Manual Shut Off</h3>
<p>Press and hold the Flight Mode button for 5 seconds until the red LED remains lit for a solid 5 seconds. This indicates the logger has exited from Flight Mode and will begin transmitting data again.</p>

</div><div id="faqs" class="rl_tabs-print"><h2 class="rl_tabs-title nn_tabs-title"><a id="anchor-faqs" class="anchor"></a>FAQs</h2>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>

<h4>How do I login?</h4>
<p>You login to the DeltaTrak service using your email address and password used creating your account.</p>

<h4>I forgot my password, what now?</h4>
<p>At the login page you can find a link for resetting your password</p>

<h2>Installing the DeltaTrak Logger:</h2>

<ol>
<li>To start the logger press and hold the green START button for 5 seconds until blue status LED is flashing.  The STATUS LED will flash 5 times to indicate it has started, and flash another 5 times to show the cellular signal is good.  If there is no cellular reception at the moment the blue STATUS light will stay lit for 5 seconds</li>
<li>Remove barcode label with trip number from card, apply to shipping document.  Trip number on RTL matches PDF trip report for traceability.</li>
<li>Use adhesive strips on back of card to place logger on pallet or package</li>
<li>Scan the QR code for detailed information on enabling and disabling FLIGHT MODE</li>
</ol>

<h4>What is Flight Mode?</h4>

<p>The Flight Mode is similar to the Airplane mode on your mobile device.  The RTL Prime can disable the data transmission of the RTL Prime logger while maintaining logging of temperature data.  The information will be stored so when the logger exits flight mode, it will report all data to our cloud.  The RTL Prime can only exit Flight Mode using a countdown internal timer.  This means once the Flight Mode is activated, the pre-programed elapsed time must pass before the logger will wake up and reconnect.</p>
<h5>MANUAL MODE:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Manually press and hold the Flight Mode button on the RTL Prime logger for 5 seconds, the logger will go from Recording Mode to Flight Mode.  The Flight Mode LED will blink RED 5 times to indicate logger has entered Flight Mode.</li>
<ul>
<li>A single press of the Flight Mode button for 1 second will return a Red LED to indicate logger is in Flight Mode.</li>
<li>Press and hold Flight Mode button for 5 seconds and the Red LED will go solid for 5 seconds and exit Flight Mode</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Why is there a USB port on my device?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The USB port allows users to download data from the RTL Prime without having to access the cloud account.  Simply plug in the logger into a compatible USB port on the computer and a PDF report will be generated automatically</li>
<li>For the RTL Prime 3G unit, there is a micro USB port at the bottom of the unit.  You will need a micro USB to USB cable to download the file</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Questions:</h2>

<h4>How is the DeltaTrak device connected to Internet?</h4>
<p>The RTL Prime uses 2G GSM and/or 3G GSM (model 22366) to connect to internet in very similar way as a mobile phone. The device is equipped with a pre-paid SIM card that works world wide.</p>

<h4>Why hasn't my DeltaTrak device updated in a while?</h4>
<p>There are many possible reasons why the device doesn't have connectivity.</p>

<p>If the device is in a steel container in a rural area with bad GSM coverage, or out at sea outside GSM reach, the device will not be able to connect. However the device is still measuring and collecting sensor data even if there's is no GSM connectivity. As soon as the device is within GSM reach, all data from last successful connection will be uploaded to the cloud. </p>
<p>If you use your DeltaTrak device in reefer containers GSM signal is also affected by how the container is stacked on a ship or in a harbor. For instance if your container is in the middle of many other containers it might be very difficult to get GSM connectivity. However - as soon as your container is moved or transferred to another location all data from the last successful connection should be uploaded to the cloud.</p>
