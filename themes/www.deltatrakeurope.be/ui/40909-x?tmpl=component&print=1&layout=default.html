<h3>Q. Why can’t I add my logger to the app.​</h3>
<p>A. Your smartphone must have Bluetooth version 4.0 or greater. Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your phone (turned ON) and that the logger activated and the blue Active LED flashing. Then try to add the logger. If it fails, click on ‘Retry’. It should connect after a few tries. </p>
